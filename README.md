Exercise 1 Consider   a   game   in   which   player   1   first   selects   between   I   and   O.   If   player   1   selects   O,   then   the   game   ends   with   the   payoff   vector   (x,1)   (x   for   player   1),   where   x   is   some   positive   number.    If   player      1   selects   I,   then this   selection   is   revealed   to   player   2   and   then   the   players   play   the   battle-of-the-sexes   game   in   which   they simultaneously   and   independently   choose   between   A   and   B.   If they   coordinate   on   A,   then   the   payoff vector   is   (3, 1).   If   they   coordinate   on   B,   then   the   payoff   vector   is   (1   ,   3).    If   they   fail   to   coordinate,   then   the   payoff vector   is   (0,   0).
(a)    Represent   this   game   in   the   extensive   and   normal   forms.   (b)      Find   the   pure-strategy   Nash   equilibria   of this   game.
(c)    Calculate   the   mixed-strategy   Nash   equilibria   and   note   how   they   depend   on   x.
(d)      Represent   the   proper   subgame   in   the   normal   form   and   find   its   equilibria.
(e)   What   are   the   pure-strategy   subgame   perfect   equilibria   of   the   game?    Can   you   find   any   Nash   equilibria that   are   not   subgame   perfect?
(f)   What   are   the   mixed-strategy   subgame   perfect   equilibria   of the   game?
Exercise 2 Consider   the   following   game.      An   incumbent   monopolist   (firm   1)   can   either   be   passive   or   take   a   specific action   which   costs   K   dollars.    A   potential   entrant   (firm   2) observes   this   and   decides   whether   to   enter   or   not.   If she   stays   out   her   profits   are   zero,   while   the   incumbent’s   profits   are   the   monopoly   profits   πM       (minus   the   cost   of   the   action,   if   such   action   was   taken).      If   the   incumbent   took   the   action   and   the   potential   entrant   stays   out,   the   incumbent   has   a   choice   between   undoing the   action   (thereby   recovering   K   dollars)   or   making   no   change.      A   duopoly   game   follows   the   three   situations:      (no-action,   in),    (action,   in,   undo),    (action,   in,   no-change).    Let   π be   firm   i’s   profit      (i=1,2)   at   the   unique   Nash   equilibrium   of   the   game   where   no   action was   taken   or,   if   it   was   taken,   it   was   subsequently   undone.      Let   πi(0)      be   firm   i’s   profit   at   the   unique   Nash equilibrium   of   the   remaining   duopoly   game.   Assume   that   π2(*)      > 0   and   π > πi(0)      for   i=1,2.
(a)    Draw   the   extensive   game   described   above.
(b)      Find   the   subgame-perfect   equilibria   of   this   game.    Is   there   a   subgame-perfect   equilibrium   characterized by   entry   deterrence?
Exercise 3

(a)    Solve   the   game   by   backward   induction   and   report   the   strategy   profile   that   results.
(b)    How   many   proper   subgames   does   this   game   have?
(c)      SPE?
Exercise 4 Two   individuals,   A   and   B,   are working on   a join   project.    They   can   devote   it   either   high   effort or   low effort.   If   both   players   devote   high   effort,   the   outcome   of   the   project   is   of   high   quality   and   each   one   receives   100$.   If   one   or   both   devote   low   effort,   the   outcome   of   the   project   is   of   low   quality   and   each   one   receives   50$.    The opportunity   cost   to   provide   high   effort   is   30.      The   opportunity   cost   to   provide   low   effort   is   0.   Individual   A   moves   first,   individual   B   observes   the   action   of   A   and   then   moves.

Exercise 5 Consider   the   following   game   in   extensive   form.    On   the   nodes   where      1   (respectively   2)   is   written,   player   1   (respectively   2) moves.   For   each   outcome   of代 写Game Theory - Review Questions Test 3Java

A   finitely   repeated   game.   Consider   the   two-player   game

1.    Find   all   the   pure-strategy   Nash   equilibria   of this   game.
2.    Suppose   that   this   game   is   played   twice   (i.e., played   and   then   repeated   once).    Construct   a   pure-strategy SPE   in   which   (D,   d)   is   played   in   the   first   stage.
Exercise 7 
Assume   that   this   game   is   repeated   an   infinite   number   of   times,   and   that   both   the   row   and   column   player   discount   the   future   with   the   same   discount   factor   δ   .

1.    Suppose   that   both   players   follow   the   following   grim-trigger   strategy:    ”play   c   as   long   as   no-one   has   ever played   d;   otherwise   play   d”   .    Find   the   minimum   value    /delta   of   such   that   this   is   a   subgame-perfect   equilibria.
2.    Suppose   that   row   and   column   are   playing   some   SPE   equilibrium   of   the   in
nitely   repeated   game.      They   may   or   may   not   have   played   according   to   the   equilibrium   strategies   so far.   Let   Vr    and   Vc    denote   the   present   discounted   values   of continuing   to   play   from   here   on   according to the equilibrium strategies.   What   are the   lowest   values   that   Vr      and   Vc    could   have?    [Hint:   there   are   no   calculations   involved   here 
Exercise 8:Infinitely repeated games Boston   Heat   and   Boston   Warmth   are   the   only   two   firms   allowed   to   provide   home-heating   oil   in   Boston.   Each   firm   has   a   constant   marginal   cost   of   supplying   oil   equal   to   1   per   gallon.    Let   the   prices   per   gallon   of   the   two   firm   be   ph      and   pw      respectively.    Heating   oil   is   a   perfectly   homogeneous   good,   so   all   customers   buy from   whichever   company   offer   the   lower   price.   The   total   demand   for   oil   in   Boston   is   given   by   the   following   demand   function:   Q(pL   ) = 200,   000 −   100,   000pLwhere   pL      is   whichever   is   the   lower   of   ph      and   pw   .    For   example,   if   ph         =   $0   and   pw         =   $1.50,   then   total sales   in   Boston   would   be   200,000   gallons,   all   customers   would   buy   from   Heat,   and   Heat   would   make   losses   of   $200,000.      If   ph   =   $1:75   and   pw   =   $1:25,   then   total   sales   would   be   200,000   -   100,000   (1.25)   =   75.000   gallons,   all   customers   would   buy   from   Warmth,   and   Warmth   would   make   prots   of   $18,750.    Assume   that,   if   Heat   and   Warmth   announce   the   same   price,   demand   splits   exactly   equally between   the   two   firms.
1.      For   the   moment,   suppose   that   this   competition   between   Heat   and   Warmth   occurs   just   once.   Suppose that   the   firm   announce   their   prices   simultaneous.
a   What   prices   are   strictly   dominated   strategies,   and   what   prices   are   weakly   dominated   strategie
b      Find   all   the   Nash   equilibria   in   this   game.    For   all   the   Nash   equilibria   in   this   game,   what   is   the   equilibrium   price pL   .
2.      Now   suppose   that   this   competition   is   played   repeatedly,   year   after   year,      and   that   both   firm   have   discount   factor   δ   .
a      Find   the   lowest   δ   such   that   the   firm   are   able   to   sustain   the   monopoly   price   in   a   subgame   perfect equilibrium.      Construct   such   an   equilibrium   and   explain   briefly   why   no   other   subgame   perfect   equilibrium   can   sustain   the   monopoly   price   at   a   lower   δ   .
b      Suppose   instead   that   the   demand   for   heating   is   given   by   Q(pL   )   =   a−b*pL      gallons,   where   a   >   1,   and   b   > 0.    In   this   case,   what   is   the   lowest   δ   such   that   firms   can   sustain   the   monopoly   price   in   a subgame   perfect   equilibrium.   Explain   what   is   general   about   this   result   and   why?
